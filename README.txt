This is a modified version of mojo to run on Perl-5.8.7 environment.
The API is expected to be compatible with Mojolicious v3.43.

The code is experimental and might not work in all cases.

Note: Some tests must be failed. You better test first and make sure the
failing tests are not critical for you.
