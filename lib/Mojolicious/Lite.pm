=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Lite - Real-time micro web framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Automatically enables "strict", "warnings", "utf8" and Perl 5.10 features
  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Route with placeholder
  get '/:foo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $foo  = $self->param('foo');
    $self->render(text => "Hello from $foo.");
  };

  # Start the Mojolicious command system
  app->start;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Lite> is a micro real-time web framework built around
L<Mojolicious>.

=head1 TUTORIAL

A quick example driven introduction to the wonders of L<Mojolicious::Lite>.
Most of what you'll learn here also applies to normal L<Mojolicious>
applications.

=head2 Hello World

A simple Hello World application can look like this, L<strict>, L<warnings>,
L<utf8> and Perl 5.10 features are automatically enabled and a few functions
imported when you use L<Mojolicious::Lite>, turning your script into a full
featured web application.

  #!/usr/bin/env perl
  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  get '/' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Hello World!');
  };

  app->start;

There is also a helper command to generate a small example application.

  $ mojo generate lite_app

=head2 Commands

All the normal L<Mojolicious::Commands> are available from the command line.
Note that CGI and L<PSGI> environments can usually be auto detected and will
just work without commands.

  $ ./myapp.pl daemon
  Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

  $ ./myapp.pl daemon -l http://*:8080
  Server available at http://127.0.0.1:8080.

  $ ./myapp.pl cgi
  ...CGI output...

  $ ./myapp.pl
  ...List of available commands (or automatically detected environment)...

The C<app-E<gt>start> call that starts the L<Mojolicious> command system
should usually be the last expression in your application and can be
customized to override normal C<@ARGV> use.

  app->start('cgi');

=head2 Reloading

Your application will automatically reload itself if you start it with the
C<morbo> development web server, so you don't have to restart the server after
every change.

  $ morbo myapp.pl
  Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

For more information about how to deploy your application see also
L<Mojolicious::Guides::Cookbook/"DEPLOYMENT">.

=head2 Routes

Routes are basically just fancy paths that can contain different kinds of
placeholders and usually lead to an action. The first argument passed to all
actions (the invocant C<$self>) is a L<Mojolicious::Controller> object
containing both the HTTP request and response.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Route leading to an action
  get '/foo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Hello World!');
  };

  app->start;

Response content is often generated by actions with
L<Mojolicious::Controller/"render">, but more about that later.

=head2 GET/POST parameters

All GET and POST parameters sent with the request are accessible via
L<Mojolicious::Controller/"param">.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /foo?user=sri
  get '/foo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $user = $self->param('user');
    $self->render(text => "Hello $user.");
  };

  app->start;

=head2 Stash and templates

The L<Mojolicious::Controller/"stash"> is used to pass data to templates,
which can be inlined in the C<DATA> section.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Route leading to an action that renders a template
  get '/bar' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->stash(one => 23);
    $self->render('baz', two => 24);
  };

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ baz.html.ep
  The magic numbers are <%= $one %> and <%= $two %>.

For more information about templates see also
L<Mojolicious::Guides::Rendering/"Embedded Perl">.

=head2 HTTP

L<Mojolicious::Controller/"req"> and L<Mojolicious::Controller/"res"> give you
full access to all HTTP features and information.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Access request and response information
  get '/agent' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $host = $self->req->url->to_abs->host;
    my $ua   = $self->req->headers->user_agent;
    $self->res->headers->header('X-Bender' => 'Bite my shiny metal ass!');
    $self->render(text => "Request by $ua reached $host.");
  };

  app->start;

=head2 Route names

All routes can have a name associated with them, this allows automatic
template detection and back referencing with
L<Mojolicious::Controller/"url_for"> as well as many helpers like
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::TagHelpers/"link_to">. Nameless routes get an
automatically generated one assigned that is simply equal to the route itself
without non-word characters.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Render the template "index.html.ep"
  get '/' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render;
  } => 'index';

  # Render the template "hello.html.ep"
  get '/hello';

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ index.html.ep
  <%= link_to Hello  => 'hello' %>.
  <%= link_to Reload => 'index' %>.

  @@ hello.html.ep
  Hello World!

=head2 Layouts

Templates can have layouts too, you just select one with the helper
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers/"layout"> and place the result of the
current template with the helper
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers/"content">.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  get '/with_layout';

  app->start;

=head2 Blocks

Template blocks can be used like normal Perl functions and are always
delimited by the C<begin> and C<end> keywords.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  get '/with_block' => 'block';

  app->start;
  __DATA__

=head2 Captured content

The helper L<Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers/"content_for"> can be used to
pass around blocks of captured content.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  get '/captured';

  app->start;
  __DATA__

=head2 Helpers

You can also extend L<Mojolicious> with your own helpers, a list of all
built-in ones can be found in L<Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers> and
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::TagHelpers>.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # A helper to identify visitors
  helper whois => sub {
    my $self  = shift;
    my $agent = $self->req->headers->user_agent || 'Anonymous';
    my $ip    = $self->tx->remote_address;
    return "$agent ($ip)";
  };

    $self->app->log->debug("Request from $user.");
  };

=head2 Placeholders

Route placeholders allow capturing parts of a request path until a C</> or
C<.> separator occurs, results are accessible via
L<Mojolicious::Controller/"stash"> and L<Mojolicious::Controller/"param">.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /foo/test
  # /foo/test123
  get '/foo/:bar' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $bar  = $self->stash('bar');
    $self->render(text => "Our :bar placeholder matched $bar");
  };

  # /testsomething/foo
  # /test123something/foo
  get '/(:bar)something/foo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $bar  = $self->param('bar');
    $self->render(text => "Our :bar placeholder matched $bar");
  };

  app->start;

=head2 Relaxed Placeholders

Relaxed placeholders allow matching of everything until a C</> occurs.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /test/hello
  # /test123/hello
  # /test.123/hello
  get '/#you/hello' => 'groovy';

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ groovy.html.ep
  Your name is <%= $you %>.

=head2 Wildcard placeholders

Wildcard placeholders allow matching absolutely everything, including C</> and
C<.>.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /hello/test
  # /hello/test123
  # /hello/test.123/test/123
  get '/hello/*you' => 'groovy';

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ groovy.html.ep
  Your name is <%= $you %>.

=head2 HTTP methods

Routes can be restricted to specific request methods with different keywords.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # GET /hello
  get '/hello' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Hello World!');
  };

  # PUT /hello
  put '/hello' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $size = length $self->req->body;
    $self->render(text => "You uploaded $size bytes to /hello.");
  };

  # GET|POST|PATCH /bye
  any [qw(GET POST PATCH)] => '/bye' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Bye World!');
  };

  # * /whatever
  any '/whatever' => sub {
    my $self   = shift;
    my $method = $self->req->method;
    $self->render(text => "You called /whatever with $method.");
  };

  app->start;

=head2 Optional placeholders

Routes allow default values to make placeholders optional.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /hello
  # /hello/Sara
  get '/hello/:name' => {name => 'Sebastian'} => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render('groovy', format => 'txt');
  };

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ groovy.txt.ep
  My name is <%= $name %>.

=head2 Restrictive placeholders

The easiest way to make placeholders more restrictive are alternatives, you
just make a list of possible values.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /test
  # /123
  any '/:foo' => [foo => [qw(test 123)]] => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $foo  = $self->param('foo');
    $self->render(text => "Our :foo placeholder matched $foo");
  };

  app->start;

All placeholders get compiled to a regular expression internally, this process
can also be easily customized.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /1
  # /123
  any '/:bar' => [bar => qr/\d+/] => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $bar  = $self->param('bar');
    $self->render(text => "Our :bar placeholder matched $bar");
  };

  app->start;

Just make sure not to use C<^> and C<$> or capturing groups C<(...)>, because
placeholders become part of a larger regular expression internally, C<(?:...)>
is fine though.

=head2 Under

Authentication and code shared between multiple routes can be realized easily
with bridge routes generated by the C<under> statement. All following routes
are only evaluated if the callback returned a true value.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Authenticate based on name parameter
  under sub {
    my $self = shift;

    # Authenticated
    my $name = $self->param('name') || '';
    return 1 if $name eq 'Bender';

    # Not authenticated
    $self->render('denied');
    return undef;
  };

  # Only reached when authenticated
  get '/' => 'index';

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ denied.html.ep
  You are not Bender, permission denied.

  @@ index.html.ep
  Hi Bender.

Prefixing multiple routes is another good use for C<under>.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /foo
  under '/foo';

  # /foo/bar
  get '/bar' => {text => 'foo bar'};

  # /foo/baz
  get '/baz' => {text => 'foo baz'};

  # / (reset)
  under '/' => {message => 'whatever'};

  # /bar
  get '/bar' => {inline => '<%= $message %> works'};

  app->start;

You can also C<group> related routes, which allows nesting of multiple
C<under> statements.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Global logic shared by all routes
  under sub {
    my $self = shift;
    return 1 if $self->req->headers->header('X-Bender');
    $self->render(text => "You're not Bender.");
    return undef;
  };

  # Admin section
  group {

    # Local logic shared only by routes in this group
    under '/admin' => sub {
      my $self = shift;
      return 1 if $self->req->headers->header('X-Awesome');
      $self->render(text => "You're not awesome enough.");
      return undef;
    };

    # GET /admin/dashboard
    get '/dashboard' => {text => 'Nothing to see here yet.'};
  };

  # GET /welcome
  get '/welcome' => {text => 'Hi Bender.'};

  app->start;

=head2 Formats

Formats can be automatically detected by looking at file extensions.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /detection.html
  # /detection.txt
  get '/detection' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render('detected');
  };

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ detected.html.ep
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head><title>Detected</title></head>
    <body>HTML was detected.</body>
  </html>

  @@ detected.txt.ep
  TXT was detected.

Restrictive placeholders can also be used.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /hello.json
  # /hello.txt
  get '/hello' => [format => [qw(json txt)]] => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->render(json => {hello => 'world'})
      if $self->stash('format') eq 'json';
    $self->render(text => 'hello world');
  };

  app->start;

Or you can just disable format detection.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /hello
  get '/hello' => [format => 0] => {text => 'No format detection.'};

  # Disable detection and allow the following routes selective re-enabling
  under [format => 0];

  # /foo
  get '/foo' => {text => 'No format detection again.'};

  # /bar.txt
  get '/bar' => [format => 'txt'] => {text => ' Just one format.'};

  app->start;

=head2 Content negotiation

For resources with different representations and that require truly C<RESTful>
content negotiation you can also use L<Mojolicious::Controller/"respond_to">.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /hello (Accept: application/json)
  # /hello (Accept: application/xml)
  # /hello.json
  # /hello.xml
  # /hello?format=json
  # /hello?format=xml
  get '/hello' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->respond_to(
      json => {json => {hello => 'world'}},
      xml  => {text => '<hello>world</hello>'},
      any  => {data => '', status => 204}
    );
  };

  app->start;

MIME type mappings can be extended or changed easily with
L<Mojolicious/"types">.

  app->types->type(rdf => 'application/rdf+xml');

=head2 Static files

Similar to templates, but with only a single file extension and optional
Base64 encoding, static files can be inlined in the C<DATA> section and are
served automatically.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ something.js
  alert('hello!');

  @@ test.txt (base64)
  dGVzdCAxMjMKbGFsYWxh

External static files are not limited to a single file extension and will be
served automatically from a C<public> directory if it exists.

  $ mkdir public
  $ mv something.js public/something.js
  $ mv mojolicious.tar.gz public/mojolicious.tar.gz

Both have a higher precedence than routes.

=head2 External templates

External templates will be searched by the renderer in a C<templates>
directory if it exists.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Render template "templates/foo/bar.html.ep"
  any '/external' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render('foo/bar');
  };

  app->start;

=head2 Conditions

Conditions such as C<agent> and C<host> from
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::HeaderCondition> allow even more powerful route
constructs.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Firefox
  get '/foo' => (agent => qr/Firefox/) => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Congratulations, you are using a cool browser.');
  };

  # Internet Explorer
  get '/foo' => (agent => qr/Internet Explorer/) => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Dude, you really need to upgrade to Firefox.');
  };

  # http://mojolicio.us/bar
  get '/bar' => (host => 'mojolicio.us') => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Hello Mojolicious.');
  };

  app->start;

=head2 Sessions

Signed cookie based sessions just work out of the box as soon as you start
using them through the helper
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers/"session">, just be aware that all
session data gets serialized with L<Mojo::JSON>.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Access session data in action and template
  get '/counter' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->session->{counter}++;
  };

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ counter.html.ep
  Counter: <%= session 'counter' %>

Note that you should use a custom L<Mojolicious/"secret"> to make signed
cookies really secure.

  app->secret('My secret passphrase here');

=head2 File uploads

All files uploaded via C<multipart/form-data> request are automatically
available as L<Mojo::Upload> objects. And you don't have to worry about memory
usage, because all files above C<250KB> will be automatically streamed into a
temporary file.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Upload form in DATA section
  get '/' => 'form';

  # Multipart upload handler
  post '/upload' => sub {
    my $self = shift;

    # Check file size
    return $self->render(text => 'File is too big.', status => 200)
      if $self->req->is_limit_exceeded;

    # Process uploaded file
    return $self->redirect_to('form')
      unless my $example = $self->param('example');
    my $size = $example->size;
    my $name = $example->filename;
    $self->render(text => "Thanks for uploading $size byte file $name.");
  };

  app->start;

      % end
    </body>
  </html>

To protect you from excessively large files there is also a limit of C<10MB>
by default, which you can tweak with the MOJO_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE environment
variable.

  # Increase limit to 1GB
  $ENV{MOJO_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE} = 1073741824;

=head2 User agent

With L<Mojo::UserAgent>, which is available through the helper
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers/"ua">, there's a full featured HTTP and
WebSocket user agent built right in. Especially in combination with
L<Mojo::JSON> and L<Mojo::DOM> this can be a very powerful tool.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Blocking
  get '/headers' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $url  = $self->param('url') || 'http://mojolicio.us';
    my $dom  = $self->ua->get($url)->res->dom;
    $self->render(json => [$dom->find('h1, h2, h3')->text->each]);
  };

  # Non-blocking
  get '/title' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->ua->get('mojolicio.us' => sub {
      my ($ua, $tx) = @_;
      $self->render(data => $tx->res->dom->at('title')->text);
    });
  };

  # Parallel non-blocking
  get '/titles' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $delay = Mojo::IOLoop->delay(sub {
      my ($delay, @titles) = @_;
      $self->render(json => \@titles);
    });
    for my $url ('http://mojolicio.us', 'https://metacpan.org') {
      my $end = $delay->begin(0);
      $self->ua->get($url => sub {
        my ($ua, $tx) = @_;
        $end->($tx->res->dom->html->head->title->text);
      });
    }
  };

  app->start;

=head2 WebSockets

WebSocket applications have never been this simple before. Just receive
messages by subscribing to events such as
L<Mojo::Transaction::WebSocket/"json"> with L<Mojolicious::Controller/"on">
and return them with L<Mojolicious::Controller/"send">.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  websocket '/echo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->on(json => sub {
      my ($self, $hash) = @_;
      $hash->{msg} = "echo: $hash->{msg}";

L<Mojolicious::Guides::Cookbook/"REAL-TIME WEB">.

=head2 Mode

You can use the L<Mojo::Log> object from L<Mojo/"log"> to portably collect
debug messages and automatically disable them later in a production setup by
changing the L<Mojolicious> operating mode.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  get '/' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->app->log->debug('Rendering "Hello World!" message.');
    $self->render(text => 'Hello World!');
  };

  app->log->debug('Starting application.');
  app->start;

The default operating mode will usually be C<development> and can be changed
with command line options or the MOJO_MODE and PLACK_ENV environment
variables. A mode other than C<development> will raise the log level from
C<debug> to C<info>.

  $ ./myapp.pl daemon -m production

All messages will be written to C<STDERR> or a C<log/$mode.log> file if a
C<log> directory exists.

  $ mkdir log

Mode changes also affect a few other aspects of the framework, such as mode
specific C<exception> and C<not_found> templates.

=head2 Testing

Testing your application is as easy as creating a C<t> directory and filling
it with normal Perl unit tests, which can be a lot of fun thanks to
L<Test::Mojo>.

  use Test::More;
  use Test::Mojo;

  use FindBin;
  require "$FindBin::Bin/../myapp.pl";

  my $t = Test::Mojo->new;
  $t->get_ok('/')->status_is(200)->content_like(qr/Funky/);

  done_testing();

Run all unit tests with the C<test> command.

  $ ./myapp.pl test
  $ ./myapp.pl test -v
