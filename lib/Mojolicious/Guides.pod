=head1 TUTORIAL

=over 2

=item L<Mojolicious::Lite>

A fast and fun way to get started developing web applications with Mojolicious
is the L<Mojolicious::Lite> tutorial. This micro web framework is only a thin
wrapper around the normal web framework, so almost everything you learn here
also applies to full L<Mojolicious> applications. The simplified notation
introduced in the tutorial is commonly used throughout the guides and is
therefore considered a prerequisite, you should definitely take a look!
